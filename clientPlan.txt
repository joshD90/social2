- start off by creating a service creation form
    - this form will be a multi-step form   
    - this form will also have a step to create the sub categories - this will work like the salesforce one adding passing different elements over.  I will start by creating this form i think
    - will then create the other one, I will see whether i need to useContext to hold the information or perhaps a useForm hook or maybe just manage through some simple state.
    - once i have created this then I will work out a way to pass this to the backend

    - create a wrapper which holds the sidebar... we can pass through whether this is a category or a service into this sidebar.  There will be a basic element which will be the sidebar item.  This can be dropped down on smaller screens if it is a service that is passed.  This will have a fetch function which will grab categories. This will go full screen at smaller screen sizes.  The container will have to accommodate for this.
    - add in react routering
         - create a service page to view services and find a way to display sub categories. Do the full page first.
     - create a dropdown component which displays the basic information
     - create microcomponents that will will display information

    todo:

     - add image, description, create input select options for service creation form for categories
     - add in something that shows that the service has been created
