My Plan for the server;

Set up the express server.

Set up database, this will be in a class.  One of the methods will be to initialise the database, and this will be called within the server class.

The site will be able to have a range of sections
    - Services
    - Behaviour Support
    - Mental Health Information

In the services section it will be broken down Into 
    - Shelter
    - Addiction
    - Food And Materials
    - Housing
    - Support Groups
    - Mental Health
    - Family Services

Whether it is a category or a service it will have a base Class of ListItem.  This will contain
    - The Name
    - The Id
    - the goTo link
    - a method for applying the colour scheme? - this will be in the client side counterpart not here

A category will extend the List Item and contain
    - A list of all services within this category
    - A method which references the database to fill these services

The corresponding MySql table will be a category, there will be a many to one relationship with services. (Should this be many to many as there might be secondary categories it fits into) - remember the relationship is held within the services side

The service will also extend the list Item 
    - category: class
    - organisation
    - description
    - needsMet - array of strings
    - minAge
    - maxAge
    
    - contact number
    - email address
    - website
    - referral pathway description: could this be another object?
    - imageUrl
    - clientGroups : Exclusive / Range (exclusive means that they must be within this group, aka Travellers, but then male, female) - will need to be selectable from a drop down list. this will be a many to many through a junction table
    - areasServed - many to many through a junction table
    - rating
    - current average wait
    -
